# Shared UI Component Library

Welcome to the Shared UI component library! This library provides a comprehensive set of reusable components built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, following the Atomic Design methodology.

## 🎯 Philosophy

Our component library is built on these core principles:

- **Atomic Design**: Components are organized into atoms, molecules, and organisms
- **Accessibility First**: All components follow WCAG guidelines
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive types
- **Customizable**: Easy to extend and customize with Tailwind classes
- **Performance**: Optimized for minimal bundle size and fast rendering

## 🏗️ Structure

### Atoms
Basic building blocks that can't be broken down further:
- Button, Input, Label, Badge
- Checkbox, Switch, Separator
- Alert, Loading, Textarea, Tabs

### Molecules
Combinations of atoms that form functional units:
- Card (with Header, Content, Footer)
- Select (with dropdown functionality)
- Form (with validation support)
- DropdownMenu (contextual menus)

### Organisms
Complex components that combine molecules and atoms:
- AdminSidebar (configurable navigation)
- ThemeSelector (theme switching)
- Dialog (modal windows)
- Table (data display)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```tsx
// Import components from shared-ui
import { Button, Card, Dialog } from '@/shared-ui'

// Use them in your components
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Welcome!</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <Button>Get Started</Button>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

## 🎨 Theming

All components support dark mode out of the box and can be customized using CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 259 80% 60%;
  --secondary: 240 5% 96%;
  --accent: 240 5% 96%;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

## 📦 Bundle Size

We prioritize performance and minimal bundle size. Components are tree-shakeable, so you only import what you use.

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new components:
1. Follow the Atomic Design principles
2. Include TypeScript types
3. Add Storybook stories
4. Ensure accessibility
5. Write tests

Happy coding! 🎉
